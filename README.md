# ECON 602 Macro Tutorial Material
## Friday December 10, 2021
- Using NLsolve to solve nonlinear systems of equations: [example](/src/PS8q1_nlsolve.jl)
- Last Year's Final, Question 1: see Canvas: Course Material
- Implementability constraint for a dynamic stochastic problem: see Canvas: Optimal Policy: Tutorial

## Tuesday November 2, 2021
- Finish dynamic programming
- Here is the [final faster version](/src/vf_iteration_optimized.jl)
- Here is a [version that plots the convergence of the solution](/src/vf_iteration_optimized_plotting.jl)
- *Note: You will want to use more than 10 grid points! We used that number in class just to simplify visualization of the matrices.

## Friday October 29, 2021
- Numerically solving dynamic programming
- Here's a [clean version of the code we wrote in class](/src/vf_iteration_intuitive_steps_final.jl)
- Here's the [same thing built into a function](/src/vf_iteration_intuitive.jl)
- We'll start on Tuesday at the second file, optimize the code, and do some robustness checks

- Sample Julia code for PS1 Question 4 [here](/src/PS1_Q4.jl)

## Friday September 16, 2021
### Tasks
- Walk through [coding intro](/docs/Getting_started_coding_Julia.md)
- I didn't get to optimization and root finding, but a description is [here](/docs/Optimization_demo.md) and Julia file is [here](/src/Optimization_demo.jl)

### Goals
1. Some practice with git, VS Code
2. Introduction to Julia
    - Basic syntax
    - Variable types
    - Matrix operations
    - Functions, control flow, and scope
    - Optimization

### Useful resources:
- [Quantecon Introduction to Julia](https://julia.quantecon.org/index_toc.html)
- [Official Julia Manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/)

## Friday September 9, 2021
### Tasks:
1. [Install Julia, VS Code, and Julia extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/dev/gettingstarted/) (Do all)
2. [Install Git, sign up for Github, and do some basic operations](https://julia.quantecon.org/software_engineering/version_control.html) (Do everything to the end of 11.3 and read through the rest)

### Goals:
At the end of this tutorial, you should have:
1. Julia running via VS Code,
2. Git installed,
3. a Github account, and
4. an idea of how version control and collaboration works with Git/Github.

If there is time left, we'll move on to some basic programming.
